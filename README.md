## About
This repository contains our pitch materials for the 2022 WITS Case Study and Hackathon. With a focus on Target's mobile app, my team and I were tasked with enhancing the guest experience and driving top line growth. As such, we developed the case study through SWOT analysis of Target's current app and business model, and researched different solutions to improve the mobile guest experience. Our solution can be divided up into main parts; store routing, and customized incentives. The first part relies on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Technology, where we are able to provide an efficient route recommendation and navigation through the store, making the guest experience accessible as well. In the second part, we incentivize the guest experience through a custom in-app visit tracker and reward, driving customer loyalty. On the last day of WITS, my team and I delivered a final pitch presentation of our solution to Target executives, leaders, and engineers.

## The WITS
1 in 43 attendees chosen to attend the weeklong 2022 Target Women in Tech Symposium. A selective event focused on inclusion, empowerment and professional development for aspiring software engineers, I was invited to meet and learn from Target software engineers. During the event, we participated in job shadows with various Target engineers, talks and panels from tech leaders regarding Women in Tech and Diversity & Inclusion, attended workshops from the Guest eXperience Center and Shipt, and participated in professional development activities.
